Assignment 2: Graph Neural Networks

The assignment is 3 parts

1) Graph level prediction using GAT/GCN: The model is predicting a single value for an entire graph.

2) Node Cassification using GAT/GCN: The model is learning to predict one of the seven subjects.

3) Link prediction of graph: The model is predicting the conection between two nodes based on two attributes.
