Assignment 5 : Continual ML and Active Learning

Part B:- Write a colab to demonstrate active learning with lightly.ai end2end

Dataset used: PyTorch CIFAR10 Dataset

Active learning for the SMOG model of self-supervised learning. A framework for computer vision called Lightly enables self-supervised learning. Deep learning models can be trained by self-supervision utilizing Lightly. This indicates that there is no need for labels while training a model. To assist you in comprehending and use huge unlabeled datasets, Lightly was created. Because it is constructed on top of PyTorch, it is completely interoperable with various frameworks, including Fast.ai.
