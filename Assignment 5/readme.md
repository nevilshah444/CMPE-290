Assignment 5 : Continual ML and Active Learning

Part A) Do an end2end well annotated and commented demo of continual learning using avalanche library in colab

Dataset used: PermutedMNIST Dataset

On the PermutedMNIST dataset, simpleMLP modeling. Avalanche offers the approach of clear and straightforward code that makes it simple to use. The command listed below can be used to install Avalanche and its dependencies. According to resources, Avalanche uses either a CPU or a CUDA GPU. A PyTorch environment must be developed because Avalanche is built on top of PyTorch.

Part B:- Write a colab to demonstrate active learning with lightly.ai end2end

Dataset used: PyTorch CIFAR10 Dataset

Active learning for the SMOG model of self-supervised learning. A framework for computer vision called Lightly enables self-supervised learning. Deep learning models can be trained by self-supervision utilizing Lightly. This indicates that there is no need for labels while training a model. To assist you in comprehending and use huge unlabeled datasets, Lightly was created. Because it is constructed on top of PyTorch, it is completely interoperable with various frameworks, including Fast.ai.

Part C) Demonstrate the use of active learning with label studio for your favorite image task

An open source program for labeling and investigating various forms of data is called Label Studio. With numerous data formats, we are able to do various labeling types. Additionally, we can incorporate Label Studio with machine learning models to deliver label predictions (pre-labels) or carry out continuous active learning.
