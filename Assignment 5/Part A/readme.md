Assignment 5 : Continual ML and Active Learning

Part A) Do an end2end well annotated and commented demo of continual learning using avalanche library in colab

Dataset used: PermutedMNIST Dataset

On the PermutedMNIST dataset, simpleMLP modeling. Avalanche offers the approach of clear and straightforward code that makes it simple to use. The command listed below can be used to install Avalanche and its dependencies. According to resources, Avalanche uses either a CPU or a CUDA GPU. A PyTorch environment must be developed because Avalanche is built on top of PyTorch.
