Part A:

Aim: Implement a colab for reptile MAML algorithm in keras/tensorflow for meta learning on a small dataset from scratch

Part B:

Aim: Implement a colab for meta learning using prototypical networks in pytorch

Here, the algorithms are shown that learn models which can quickly adapt to new classes and/or tasks with few samples. This area of machine learning is called Meta-Learning aiming at "learning to learn".

Part C:

Aim: Implement a colab of  metalearning on top of BERT.

Here, Data is leveraged from high-resource domains to create a good "starting point". From this point, training is started a specific model for low-resource domain
