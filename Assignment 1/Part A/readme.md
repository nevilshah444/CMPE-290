Part 1) KerasModel.py
After enabling the Github Copilot in Visual Studio Code, I have built the neural network model in Keras which tries to predict the numbers from images given in MNIST dataset. After the model is trained on MNIST dataset for 10 epochs, the model is tested  and after the model is trained, the command python KerasModel.py, the model is trained and first 10 images of the testing numbers are predicted and displayed.

Part 2) pyTorchTest.py
I built a feed-forward neural network with the help of Github Copilot to predict the output of an algorithmic expression y = 2*x + 3. I passed [[1.0]] tensor as input and the model predicts the value as [[5.03]], which is very close to the expeted output.

Please refer the above video link for the demonstration of both- keras and pytorch models.
